Option jessie-int-model is used to select the way Jessie manages integers. 

Three options: 

-exact: abstract integer are used (no limits)
-modulo: such as C's int type, integer used in specification are defined on 32 bits.
-bounded: describes a modulo integer arithmetic (or saturating or trapping or whatever 2-complement arithmetic you can imagine) with additional POs proving that the values do not overflow.
Option “exact” removes the conversion predicates required to convert integer to C's int. This makes the proof easier. However, the behavior is not correct if an overflow can occur.
