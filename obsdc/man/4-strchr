STRCHR(3)                 OpenBSD Programmer's Manual                STRCHR(3)

NAME
     strchr, index - locate first occurrence of a character in a string

SYNOPSIS
     #include <string.h>

     char *
     strchr(const char *s, int c);

     char *
     index(const char *s, int c);

DESCRIPTION
     The strchr() function locates the first occurrence of the character c in
     the string s.  The terminating NUL character is considered part of the
     string.  If c is `\0', strchr() locates the terminating `\0'.

     The index() function is an old synonym for strchr().

RETURN VALUES
     The strchr() function returns a pointer to the located character or NULL
     if the character does not appear in the string.

EXAMPLES
     After the following call to strchr(), p will point to the string "oobar":

           char *p;
           char *s = "foobar";

           p = strchr(s, 'o');

STANDARDS
     The strchr() function conforms to ANSI X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C'').

     The index() function is deprecated and shouldn't be used in new code.
