STRCASECMP(3)             OpenBSD Programmer's Manual            STRCASECMP(3)

NAME
     strcasecmp, strncasecmp - compare strings, ignoring case

SYNOPSIS
     #include <string.h>

     int
     strcasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);

     int
     strncasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t len);

DESCRIPTION
     The strcasecmp() and strncasecmp() functions compare the NUL-terminated
     strings s1 and s2 and return an integer greater than, equal to, or less
     than 0, according to whether s1 is lexicographically greater than, equal
     to, or less than s2 after translation of each corresponding character to
     lower-case.  The strings themselves are not modified.  The comparison is
     done using unsigned characters, so that `\200' is greater than `\0'.

     strncasecmp() compares at most len characters.
