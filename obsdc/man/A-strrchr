STRRCHR(3)                OpenBSD Programmer's Manual               STRRCHR(3)

NAME
     strrchr, rindex - locate last occurrence of a character in a string

SYNOPSIS
     #include <string.h>

     char *
     strrchr(const char *s, int c);

     char *
     rindex(const char *s, int c);

DESCRIPTION
     The strrchr() function locates the last occurrence of the character c in
     the string s.  The terminating NUL character is considered part of the
     string.  If c is `\0', strrchr() locates the terminating `\0'.

     The rindex() function is an old synonym for strrchr().

RETURN VALUES
     The strrchr() function returns a pointer to the located character or NULL
     if the character does not appear in the string.

EXAMPLES
     After the following call to strrchr(), p will point to the string "obar":

           char *p;
           char *s = "foobar";

           p = strrchr(s, 'o');

     strstr(3), strtok(3)

STANDARDS
     The strrchr() function conforms to ANSI X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C'').

     The rindex() function is deprecated and shouldn't be used in new code.
