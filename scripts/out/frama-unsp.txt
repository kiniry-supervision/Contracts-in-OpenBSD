Arbitrary gotos
only forward gotos, not jumping into nested blocks, are allowed. There is no plan to support arbitrary gotos in the future. 
Function pointers
Arbitrary cast
•from integers to pointers, from pointer to integers: no support 
•between pointers: experimental support, only for casts in code, not logic 
Note: casts between integer types are supported 
Union types
experimental support, both in code and annotations 
Variadic C functions
unsupported 
Floating point computations
By default, float and double numbers are interpreted as reals. Consequently, it is not possible to check properties relaed to rounding errors or overflows. Experimental supports for other models are described below, see description of the FloatModel pragma
